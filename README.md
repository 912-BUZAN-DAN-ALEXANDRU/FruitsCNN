# Description

This is an App which classifies various types of Fruits and Vegetables. <br>
The UI is written in Python with TKinter. <br>
The ML Model is written using Jupyter Notebooks in Python with Keras and Tensorflow. <br>
The Model is trained in Cloud using Google Colab. <br>
***The app is in Romanian because it was my highschool graduation project***

# Problems
1. The model is inaccurate on pictures of high-resolution or pictures with other background color than white ![accuracy-graph](https://github.com/912-BUZAN-DAN-ALEXANDRU/FruitsCNN/blob/master/Screenshot%202020-05-10%20at%2000.04.02.png)<br>
2. The UI is boring and simplistic <br>

# Future plans
1. Improve the accuracy of the model
2. Add new classes to the model
2. Deploy the model by creating an user-friendly web application
